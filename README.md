# Burnout

In the context of the current pademic, _HackerEarth_ launched a machine learning competition, which focused on predicting the __burnout rate__ in a given - and fairly large - sample of employees.

Although not actively participating in the competition (we stumbled upon it several months after the deadline) we used HackerEarth dataset to train a series of increasingly complex regression models, among which an __ensemble__ of Random Forests, KNN and Locally Weighted Regression proved to be the optimal one. 

Finally, we propose that the challenge could be also approached as a classification problem, where, rather than the burnout rate, it could be useful to predict a pre-established risk class for each employee to fall into.
